My name is Allison Mitchell, I am a PhD candidate in the Corcoran History Department at the University of Virginia where I study 20th century Black political history and civil rights studies. My current work looks at Black Floridians grassroots organizing efforts throughout the 20th century as the develop their own ideas of political power and combat voter suppression. I seek understanding to what extent is the vote suppression and what is mean to be politically engaged beyond just casting a ballot. Moreover, I push us to rethink the functionality of American democracy.
